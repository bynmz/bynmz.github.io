## About
Hi there! My name is Ben. I'm a creative leader passionate about shaping compelling product visions and experiences in games and interactive simulations. With a strong foundation in real-time systems and high-fidelity visuals, I bridge ambitious creative concepts with practical execution to deliver innovative, user-centric projects.

Currently pivoting into Creative Direction and Product Ownership roles, where I can define the core experience from the ground up while leveraging my technical expertise to ensure bold ideas are fully realizable. If you're building visionary interactive products and need a product owner who understands both creativity and feasibility, let's connect!
